            <h2>History of Python</h2>
            <h3>You've learnt the basics of Python- but where did this useful language originate?</h3>
            <p>
              Python is a high level, general purpose programming language that focuses on readability of code and ease of use.
              It supports multiple paradigms, supporting it in becoming one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Python was first created in 1980, and was started to become implemented in 1989 by Guido van Rossum, in the Netherlands.
              Python was named after the show Monty Python's Flying Circus, which was a show that van Rossum enjoyed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Python 2.0 was released in 2000, and introduced many new features, including list comprehensions and garbage collection.
              Python 2.7 was released in 2000, and was the last version of Python 2, with support ending in January 1st, 2020.
            </p>
            <p>  
              
              Python 3.0 was released in 2008, and was a major revision of the language, with many features being removed or changed.
              Python 3.0 was not backwards compatible with Python 2, which caused a lot of controversy in the programming community.
              It introduced many new features, including a new syntax for print statements, and a new way of handling strings and bytes.
            </p>
            <p>
              As of writing, Python 3.13.2 is the latest version of Python, and was released on October 7th, 2024.
            </p>
            <p>
              Python continues to be a widely used langauge, being taught in schools and colleges around the world, due to its simplicity and versatility.
