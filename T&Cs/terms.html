          <p>Polygrammodes supremalis is a moth in the family Crambidae. It was described by William Schaus in 1920. It is found in Paraná, Brazil.[1]

            The wingspan is about 43 mm. The base of the forewings, except the edge of the costa and inner margin broadly to the postmedial line, is fuscous brown shot with iridescent steel. This dark area is edged in front by a fuscous brown line preceded by a dark yellow line. An angled dark yellow line edged with fuscous brown is found medially on the inner margin and the postmedial area is pale brown. The medial pale yellow area forms a large irregular triangle with its base on the costa. There is a small spot in the cell, defined by some dark scales, and there is a yellow streak on the discocellular, edged by a reddish-brown line. The costa is yellow to the apex, only crossed by the postmedial line, which is fine, fuscous brown and shaded on either side with yellow. It is followed by an irregular, narrow greyish-purple shade from veins 2 to 5, and above vein 5 to vein 7 by a similar diverging shade. The termen is pale yellow and there is a fine brown terminal line. The base and inner margin of the hindwings is brownish purple.[2]</p>
          

          <p>Alan Mathison Turing (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist.[5] He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.[6][7][8] Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science.[9]

            Born in London, Turing was raised in southern England. He graduated from King's College, Cambridge, and in 1938, earned a doctorate degree from Princeton University. During World War II, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. He led Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Turing devised techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bomba method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. He played a crucial role in cracking intercepted messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic.[10][11]
            
            After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine, one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the University of Manchester, where he contributed to the development of early Manchester computers[12] and became interested in mathematical biology. Turing wrote on the chemical basis of morphogenesis[13][1] and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.[14]
